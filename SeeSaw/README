Description:
	You are building a see-saw simulator that emulates two individuals that weight the
	same going up-and-down. On one end you have person A, Fred. Whenever he pushes up,
	he creates an effective upward velocity of 1ft/sec. On the other end you have 
	person B, Wilma. Whenever she pushes up she creates an effective velocity of 1.5ft/sec.
	Whenever, person A or B comes within 1ft of the ground they will push back up causing 
	the opposing person to come down. The maximum height any person will go is 7ft. Using
	TWO threads and TWO semaphores, write a simulator that emulates these conditions.
	
	
	Assume at time 0 person A is at the low end, one foot from the ground ready to push up.
	This means person B is at the high end, 7 feet off the ground.
	
	At the 1 second mark, person A is 2ft off the ground and person B is 6 feet off the ground.
	They continue to travel in opposite directions until person B is 1 foot off the ground.
	
	When person B is 1 foot off the ground, she will push upwards and reverse direction. Remember,
	Wilma is stronger than Fred, so one second later she will be 2.5 ft off the ground and Fred will
	be 5.5 ft.
	
	Assume simulator once started will run 10 times (up-and-down)
	In order to throttle each process, you can sleep(1 sec)
