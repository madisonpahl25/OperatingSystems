This Project was completed with the help of slides learned during OS class, and reference material on how to
work with threading and java. Generic documentation from online sources lead to my choice in using Runnable 
with my threading.

Description: Sudoku Solution Validator (Chapman University-- Operating Systems Project 1)

Requirements:
	The sudoku validator program shall validate a 9x9 completed puzzle for correctness
		-corectness means: each column and row must contain all of the digits 1-9 once
						   each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids must contain all of the digits 1-9 once

	The sudoku validator shall accept as input a ASCII .txt file whith the elements separated by 
	commas and structured as a 9x9
		-sample test cases provided for testing
		-Failed test cases will be provided and need to be demonstrated as part of the project
	
	The sudoku validator shall specify via output to the user where the error occurred (e.g. column 5,
	row 3 --preference would be 1-based answers)

	Once the sudoku validator detects an error, it must also specify what is the correct solution for that 
	cell

	The sudoku validator shall provide user feedback to the GUI CLI to help explain what is going on and the final answer
		-printouts of steps as they progress may be helpful

Implementation:
	The sudoku validator must contain at least 3 threads not-including the main thread (no max thread limit provided it does not exceed 27)
		-final answer must be provided by main thread after the helper threads complete their job
			-helper threads can provide intermeidate feedback if a failure is detected

	programming language and O/S are optional
		-preference would be to use posix threads on linux, but others are ok if necessary
		-explicit threads must be used --not implicit
			-must demonstrate creation of threads, exit of threads and joining of helper threads with main one
