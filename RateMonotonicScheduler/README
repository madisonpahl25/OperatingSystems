Requirements:
-Build Rate Monotonic Scheduler with four threads
	-Scheduler details:
		-Threads T0 - T3
		-Thread T0 has a period of 1 unit
		-Thread T1 has a period of 2 units
		-Thread T2 has a period of 4 units
		-Thread T3 has a period of 16 units
		
		-A unit shall be anywhere from 10-100 ms (depending on operating system options)
		-Each thread will execute the same doWork method but run it different amounts of times:
			-Thread T0 executes doWork 1 time
			-Thread T1 executes doWork 2 times
			-Thread T2 executes doWork 4 times
			-Thread T3 executes doWork 16 times

-Scheduler shall have a major frame period of 16 units of time
-Program shall start scheduler and four threads that are to be scheduled
	-Scheduler needs to be woken up by a periodic source (signal/timer/etc) and it shall schedule
	the threads
	-The program shall run for 10 periods and then terminate, but not before printing out how many
	times each thread ran
-Each thread shall increment a dedicated counter each time it runs
-The scheduler shall be able to identify if a thread has missed its deadline and keep track of how
many times it happens.

-The following test cases shall be demonstrated
	-Nominal case with no overruns
	-Failed case where the doWork function is called as many times as required to lead to an overrun
	condition in T0 --What happens to other threads?
	-Failed case where T2 has an overrun condition --What happens to other threads?
	-All results are printed out at the completion of the run to not effect the timing
	
-doWork function will do following
	-will multiply the content of each cell of a 10x10 matrix starting with column 0 followed by 5,
	then 1 followed by 6, etc.
